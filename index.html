                <p>And it's the best I can do with my present knowledge.</p><hr />
                <h1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>

                    <h2>7 fucking declarations.</h2>

                        <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece.
                          It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
                            <li><em>still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                            <li><em>still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                            <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

                        <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.<br />Here's how.</p>

                    <h1>Let it breathe</h1>

                        <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.<br />
                          Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping.<br />
                          The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter.
                          If you can't see that...piss off.<p/>

                        <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.<p/>

                    <h1>A little less contrast</h1>

                        <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole.
                          I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.<p/>

                    <h1>Size Matters</h1>

                        <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more.
                          Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.<p/>

                    <h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>

                        <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long.
                          Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.<p/>

                        <h2>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h2>

                            <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read.
                              Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly.
                              You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.<p/>
